Thank you for downloading data from SAMPL 09.  In the data packet you should find several varieties of files:

	.pdf files contain an overview of the compounds as well as some background information.

	.ism files contain isomeric SMILES strings for each of the molecules in the data set.

	.sdf files contain 3D coordinates for each molecule in SD format.

	.data files are example plain text files for submission of your data.  Please read the information at the head of the file which describes the required format for data submission.  Ideally, you can modify this file and turn it in when you submit predictions.

Each data set is split into three groups:  obscure, explanatory, and investigatory compounds.  Quantitative data is known for obscure compounds, but is not widely available.  Quantitative data is provided for explanatory data:  we ask participants to attempt to reproduce and explain the unusual or surprising physical properties of these compounds.  Lastly, qualitative data is lacking for investigatory compounds, providing a purely blind opportunity for prediction.


The deadline for submission of predictions is May 18, 2009.  A complete submission will include the data file referenced above, as well as another plaintext file with a detailed description of the prediction method as well as insights and comments on the explanatory compounds.

Thank you for taking part in SAMPL, and we hope this experience will spark insight and spur discussions regarding the prediction of these physical properties.  We hope you can join us for the SAMPL workshop, which will take place in Montreal during June, 2009.
