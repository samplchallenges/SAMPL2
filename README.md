Archived information/files for the SAMPL2 challenge

## Challenge overview
The SAMPL2 evaluation was carried out in the spring of 2009, organized by OpenEye, and discussed at a workshop help at McGill University in Montreal in June of 2009.

The participants were required to predict **solvation energies** and **tautomer ratios**.

## SAMPL2 special issue
The papers covering the results of the challenge were published in a [special issue](https://link.springer.com/journal/10822/volumes-and-issues/24-4) of Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design.
